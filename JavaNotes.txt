BufferedReader extends Reader

  1. It buffers the input for any input stream so that mutiple reads on the stream can be avoided.
  2. It can be used to wrap any existing Reader so that buffering can be utilized.
  3. For example, BufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("SomeFile.txt"));
      will wrap BufferedReader over FileReader and multiple input/output to the disk can be avoided.
  4. If not used then each read() or readLine() is always a read from the stream being used.

Diamond Operator
  1. Scanner Class
  Scanner extends Object 
  implements Iterator<String>
  2. JDK 7 vs JDK 9 difference in handling of the Diamond Operator
  JDK 7 - Diamond Operator cannot be used for Anonymous Inner Classes
  JDK 9 - Diamond Operator can also be used for Anonymous Inner Classes
  3. Diammond Operator was introduced in JDK 7 to simplify the use of generics.
  Generics - List<String> geeks = new ArrayList<String>();
  Same code using Diamond Operator - List<String> geeks = new ArrayList<>();
  i.e. No need to provide 'String' on the right hand side.
